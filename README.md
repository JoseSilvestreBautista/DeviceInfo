# CaseStudy Project

## Written Prompt
The most memorable challenge I have faced when it comes to Android programming would be when I first began learning how to make requests to an API. I had no idea what an API even was. Of course I also did not know how to use it. So the steps I took to address this challenge were: First, I contacted a colleague whose job is to make API’s and asked for any resources they had that I could use to start learning. They pointed me to developer.android.com. There I found all the resources I needed to set up, code, and use the library I required. At first, the code wasn’t working. My first thought was to double check the code for any errors that I could catch right away. Then I did research on the issue I was having. I would continue this process in a trial and error methodology until I figured out the problem and could solve it.
